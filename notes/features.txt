- Unique Accounts
- Tag Strains
	- Not Tried (Default)
	- Tried
	- Want to try?
	
	- Instead of tagging every strain, maybe tag 'tried' strains and
	  assume all else are untried.
	- I could tag via PK or index since both are unique. Index probs
	  better.
	- I will either need to import every strain index into a DB and tag it
	  there.
	- Or, I can only add tagged strains to user DB and then aggregate
	  tagged indexes and use that to decide what strains are not tagged.
